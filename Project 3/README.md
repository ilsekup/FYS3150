# Project 3
### Gauss Quadrature:
Gauss Legendre and Gauss Laguerre are calculated in Gauss.cpp, run by using mainGauss.cpp compiled with lib.ccp and gauss-laguerre.cpp
(mainGauss.cpp will ask for an interger for N, this will then loop over N, N*2 and N*3 and will give values for Legendre and Laguerre for all three integrationpoints. It will also ask for a lambda value, which is the approximation to infinity.)

### Monte Carlo Integration:
Run mainMC.cpp for monte carlo integration, must be compiled with MonteCarlo.cpp  
mainMC.cpp takes number of integration points as a command line argument
run mainMCMP.cpp for monte carlo integration with openMP

### Unittests:
Unittests by compiling make. Runs the Gauss.cpp to test the gauss functions. 

### Plots:
Different plots made in python by using data from the cpp calculations. All .py files are plots of some sort.
